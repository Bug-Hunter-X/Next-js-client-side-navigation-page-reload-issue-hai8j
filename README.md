# Next.js Client-Side Navigation Page Reload Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Next.js client-side navigation where using `router.push` leads to an unnecessary page reload.  The problem stems from the nature of client-side transitions and how Next.js handles them.

## Problem Description

The `pages/about.js` component uses `router.push('/')` to navigate back to the home page. While this works, it triggers a full page reload, resulting in a less-than-ideal user experience.  The goal is to achieve a seamless, instantaneous transition without the reload.

## Solution

The provided solution in `pages/about.js` modifies the navigation logic to eliminate the reload.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

4. Navigate to the About page.
5. Click the "Go Back Home" button.  Observe the page reload.  This is the bug.
6. Examine the solution in `pages/aboutSolution.js` to see how to fix this.
